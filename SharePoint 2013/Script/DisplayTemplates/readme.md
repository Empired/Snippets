# Display Templates:

* ColourPicker.js - used to add a javascript colour picker to a field called Colour via a JSLink on the field.
* kpi.js - used to present a choice (Red, Yellow, Green) field called kpiIcon using the standard SP kpidefault icons
* HarveyBalls.js - used to present a choice (0,1,2,3,4) as Harvey Balls icons using pure CSS



Notes: currently I'm using the paylord global variable as a namespace. we should change this to obsbne.

ColourPicker - this is currently based on http://jscolor.com but could use any other plug in if required.  The plugin also needs to be added to the JSLink.
