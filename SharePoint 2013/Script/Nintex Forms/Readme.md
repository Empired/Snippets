# Nintex Forms

- CommonForms.css
- CommonForms.js
- load.js

    > **Usage**: *load.js?path=/_layouts/commonForm.js*
    > This will synchrnously load a Script but without caching it. This ensures that an include in a Nintex form will always     > load the most recent version of a script. Use this approach when you use Nintex Forms for Tasks embedded in a workflow.
